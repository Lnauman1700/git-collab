<h2>This is the business</h2>
<p>Don't call us, we'll call you.</p>
<p>We're open when we feel like working, if we don't feel like working, then we're closed.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a business that didn't exist. One day i'll create a bunch of lies about this business so someone could think it's real.</p>
<p>Want to work here? Apply <a href="application.html">here</a> and since none of this is real you can pretend you work here.</p>
<p>Questions, comments or complaints? <a href="contact.html">Let me know here!</a>
